This is a website I have from scratch, with no help from things like Bootstrap or similar to teach myself how to code and work 
on front end development. I used CSS, HTML, Javascript, Jquery, some Php(not currently fully functional) google API, css grid and flexbox and 
many google searches and and late nights to be able to complete my vision(partially). I will be updating my website and the projects
displayed in it as I continue learning and developing new skills as a sort of benchmark measurement for my accomplishments.

So far I have a couple of projects I worked on including 3 websites and 2 data analyzation projects using Python and Jupyter notebooks.

The first Website I worked on is "Lensflareon", a website I plan to move on from the development stage and into development as my main
art website. The look and feel of it is meant to be simplistic and to the point, with the focal point being the images(provided by pexels 
for now) and the art I have worked on or will in the future. The colors of the main page are a little retro and are supposed to be 
a play on the name "Lens(FLARE)on". The prints section will be replaced by "Shop" in the future for all kinds of art but right. It is
designed in a very simple looking card view (the kind of interface you would expect from the local library website) that has information 
on the artwork, price and a description. You can click on prints and they will be added to a cart which has limited funcitonality at the moment.
The contact page on this website is a bit lackluster as I plan on developing artwork and getting some fun pictures to personalize it
to my liking for future deployment.

The second website featured was inspired by an actual auto auction website that used Wix to design and deploy it. I thought it would
be a good challenge to try and emulate the site as best as I could and even make some changes of my own to make the funcitonality and
design better. The I mainly emulated the original website layout and I changed everything else by making my own logo, color scheme, and
adding mobile functionality and responsiveness that the original lacked. This website, with a couple of small changes, can be fully 
funcitonal and be deployed for any real company but I will not be working on it's backend or additional functionality(google maps api)
as it was made mostly for fun and as a challenge to myself. This project is considered done and shelved.

The last website is my latest creation and although it is still in it's early phase of design I wanted to showcase it as it will be
my first use of CSS grid which is really fun and intuitive to use as opposed to all the floats I had to use in my previous projects.
My plan for this will be a real website that functions as a shuffled playlist. I will be using the Spotify developer API to add song
funcitonality. The main gist of the site will be that a music conosseaur can go to the site and find new music to listen to. 
The albums will appear scattered on the screen or in a neat row depending on user preferences after which they can click on the art
and start playing the music that coincides with the album art. Afterwards if they like the music they can add it automatically to 
their spotify playlist or click the shuffle button which will generate 10 new albums to listen to for the listener.

The last two projects desplayed are data analysis of mine that I am proud of and would like to display. They are analysis done in 
python using (mainly) the Numpy and Pandas libraries. Both projects use algorithms that are trained by datasets that my laptop could
handle and tested on predetermined test datasets. Both have statistically significant results and small margins of error and fun graphs
that people can look at.
